# salvo

This is a web-based battleship game (sometimes known as Salvo).

The frontend is built on a combination of vanilla ES6, as well as some Vue-based components for reactivity.

The backend is built on Java's Spring framework, as well as additional libraries to handle authentication and security. 

The game is not yet hosted on a live server, but is fully operational on your own machine! Simply open the project in
an IDE like IntelliJ, press run, and fire away!
